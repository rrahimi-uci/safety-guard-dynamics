"""Non-HARKing analyzer for the starting-type adaptation study (proposal Sec 3/6/9/10).

This is the confirmatory analyzer that replaces the post-hoc-verdict defect of
``experiments/analyze_klsft.py`` (which auto-selects a "best" beta and derives verdict
wording after seeing the point estimates). Here EVERY interpretation string is selected
ONLY by locked, bootstrap-bound predicate outcomes via a claim-registry mapping; no branch
ever inspects the sign of a point estimate.

Reads the starting-type score parquet emitted by ``eval_starting_type_adaptation.py``
(columns include: ``starting_model_key``, ``starting_type``, ``adaptation`` in
{unmodified, sft, kl_sft}, ``seed``, ``kl_beta``, ``source``, ``split``, ``gold``,
``family_id``, ``score_raw``). It scores on the RAW logit margin (never the saturating
sigmoid) using the canonical tie-aware ``guard_research.metrics.average_precision``.

Estimands (proposal Sec 6), with a regime ``R`` = evaluation split (represented = id_test,
adaptation-held-out = transfer_test) and ``M(i,a,R)`` = macro-AP (mean over the benchmark
``source`` values in that split of tie-aware AP):

  * within-checkpoint movement  Delta_a(i,R) = mean_r[M(i,a,R,r) - M(i,U,R)]  for a in {sft, kl};
  * seed-paired KL preservation P(i,R) = mean_r[M(i,kl,R,r) - M(i,sft,R,r)];
  * two-dimensional movement vectors theta_a,i = (Delta_a(i,represented), Delta_a(i,heldout));
  * equal-FAMILY means: average checkpoints within a model family first (both Qwen sizes are one
    family), then average across families -- Delta_sft(f,R), P(f,R);
  * headroom-normalized gains Delta/(1 - AP_U), reported ALONGSIDE the raw deltas (Sec 3 ceiling
    confound).

Confirmatory predicates (proposal Sec 3):

  H_gain     = mean_f Delta_sft(f, represented)
  H_conc     = mean_f [Delta_sft(f, represented) - Delta_sft(f, heldout)]
  H_preserve = mean_f P(f, heldout)
  H_cost     = mean_f P(f, represented)

Each carries a ONE-SIDED 97.5% bootstrap LOWER bound (the 2.5th percentile) from a family-aware
paired bootstrap that resamples evaluation near-duplicate families (Poisson(1) weights over
``family_id``) and training seeds while holding MODEL IDENTITIES FIXED. These bounds are therefore
CONDITIONAL ON THE FIXED MODEL PANEL: they carry only eval-row and seed uncertainty, not
between-model-family uncertainty, and one dominant family can drive the equal-family mean.

Gates (Bonferroni across the two RQ families -> one-sided 97.5% per family controls FWER 0.05):

  RQ1 supported  iff  LCB(H_gain) > 0   AND  LCB(H_conc) > 0
  RQ2 supported  iff  LCB(H_preserve) > 0  AND  LCB(H_cost) > -m,   m = 0.02 AP
