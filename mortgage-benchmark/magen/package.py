Emits a distributable bundle plus a TEXT-FREE public index. Raw prompt text and the sealed

DATA_CARD = """# Mortgage Guardrail Benchmark — Data Card

**Version:** {version}
**Built:** by the agentic HMDA-grounded generator in this folder under seed {seed}. The seed fixes
sampling and split assignment, but the generation calls run at nonzero temperature (default 0.7,
`magen/llm.py`), so a rebuild reproduces the *design* and the splits, **not** the exact row text.
Treat the committed JSONL as the artifact of record.

## What this is
A request-screening benchmark for a mortgage-specific safety guardrail. Each row is one
incoming request to a mortgage workflow, carrying TWO independent policy labels
(`general_safety_gold` G, `mortgage_policy_gold` D), a derived `final_intervention_gold`, an
`action_gold` lattice, quadrant, and severity. Scenarios are grounded in the public HMDA 2022
National Loan-Level Snapshot for realism; **no real individual record or PII is reproduced** —
grounding uses aggregate/de-identified fields only.

## Honesty / construct validity
- Prompts are **synthetic**; harmful requests are *represented for detection*, never operational
  recipes. `contains_real_pii=false` is a hard schema constant.
- Labels are **policy-card-consistent, not legally authoritative**. `legal_review_status`
  records this. Confirmatory fair-lending claims require the SME-adjudicated subset (not yet done).
- The `private_test` split is **held out by convention, not sealed**. This builder writes it outside
  the distributable bundle (only its text-free index goes in), but that is a property of the bundle,
  not of a release: in v1 the committed release directory was assembled by hand and *does* include
  `private_test.jsonl` with full text, and the GPT baseline has already scored it. Before treating
  this split as unseen, verify whether the file is committed and whether anything has scored it.
- Isolation is at the `content_family` level only. Pairs (`pair_id`) were **not** a grouping key, so
  a protected pair can span two splits; check this directly rather than assuming pair isolation.

## Splits
{splits}

## License
{license}

## Reproduce
See the folder README. There is no `make all` target; the build is driven by the `magen` pipeline
steps documented there, and see the determinism note above before expecting byte-identical output.
