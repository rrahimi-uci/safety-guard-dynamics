"""Aggregate digest of a source tree, for verifying that a migration copied it faithfully.

Written because the first pass at this comparison hashed only non-ignored files and so
reported "one divergent file" while the new tree was in fact missing two placeholder
files. A digest whose coverage rule is implicit will eventually be trusted for something
it never looked at, so the rule is stated here and printed with every result.

Coverage rule
-------------
Include every regular file under the tree, EXCEPT:

* build residue -- ``__pycache__/``, ``*.pyc``/``*.pyo``, ``.pytest_cache/``,
  ``*.egg-info/``, ``.DS_Store``
* the *contents* of generated/local output directories -- ``artifacts/``, ``inputs/``,
  ``build/`` -- because those hold development output and licensed corpora that a
  migration deliberately does not copy

but DO include ``.gitkeep`` placeholders inside those directories, since a placeholder is
tracked source that defines the layout, not output. That single exception is what the
first pass got wrong.

Deliberately independent of ``git check-ignore``: the two trees do not have the same
ignore semantics. ``papers/unified-report/archive/paper_c/.gitignore`` excludes ``artifacts/`` as a directory,
which makes the package's own ``!artifacts/.gitkeep`` negation dead there but live in
``studies/``. A digest that inherited that asymmetry could not compare the trees at all.

Usage
-----
    python tools/tree_digest.py <tree> [<tree> ...] [--json] [--diff]

``--diff`` requires exactly two trees and lists relative paths that are missing from one
side or differ in content. ``--exclude <relpath>`` omits a path from the digest -- needed
for a manifest that records the hash of the tree it lives in, which is otherwise stale as
soon as it is written.
