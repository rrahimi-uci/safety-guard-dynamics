"""Enforce the Phase 5 migration manifest instead of trusting it.

`studies/paper-c-specialize-align-mortgage-v1/provenance/MIGRATION_MANIFEST.json` asserts
that the study package is a faithful copy of `papers/unified-report/archive/paper_c/specialize_then_align` and
that the old tree is still intact. An assertion written once, by hand, decays: the first
version of that manifest claimed the trees differed by one file when the copy had in fact
dropped three layout placeholders, because the comparison it was based on could not see
files under ignored prefixes. These tests recompute the comparison from the trees on disk
so the claim either holds or the suite fails.
